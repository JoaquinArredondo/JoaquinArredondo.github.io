                <p>Hello everyone! I am glad to be given this opportunity.</p>
                <p>My name is <strong>Joaquin Arredondo</strong> and I am a 2nd year <b>Computer Science</b> student. I am from the Bay 
                Area more specifically East Bay (I live in Newark, but since most people don't know where that is I just say Fremont / Union City / Hayward). </p>
                <p> I like doing digital art on Procreate, I like singing and did acapella for 4 years in high school and did the choir 
                 program here at Cal Poly, Polyphonics for about a year, my favorite show is Avatar the Last Airbender, 
                 and I'm a part of the engineering fraternity <em>Sigma Phi Delta.</em></p>
